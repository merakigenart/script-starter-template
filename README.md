# Meraki Script Starter Template

This template can be used to get started developing a Script for Meraki quickly and easily.

Your project must contain at least two files - `Script.js` and `ScriptTraits.js`.  See the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/merakigenart/meraki-js-sdk/blob/main/README.md) for more a comprehensive description of the requirements when using the SDK.

To get started, run the setup command below and you can jump right into developing a P5.js script using our SDK.

## Setup

To get started, you need to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Previewing Your Work

To start a web server that will display the current rendering of your script, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open the url generated by this command in your browser to view your rendered image.

## Bundle Your Work

To bundle your project's source code into a zip archive for submission to Meraki:

```bash
npm run bundle
```

You may then submit the newly created `project.zip` file on the Meraki project dashboard:

Uploading the file does not submit it for review - it streamlines the process of getting your code into the platform, where they can be edited, rendered and submitted for review.
